title: "Knowing Before Saying: LLM Representations Encode Information About Chain-of-Thought Success Before Completion"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/CoTpred
excerpt: 'We show that a classifier can predict zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) success from LLM representations even before any tokens are generated, indicating crucial reasoning information is present early. This suggests CoT reasoning can often be truncated for efficiency without major performance loss. Our results provide guidance for optimizing CoT processes using early stopping.'
