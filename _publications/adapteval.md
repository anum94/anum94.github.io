title: "AdaptEval: Evaluating Large Language Models on Domain Adaptation for Text Summarization"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/adapteval
excerpt: 'We introduce AdaptEval, a new evaluation suite to study how well large language models adapt to summarization tasks in various domains. By benchmarking multiple models in both fine-tuning and in-context learning scenarios, we find that model size has little impact on in-context learning performance.'
