The master course [SEBA Master: Web Application Engineering](https://wwwmatthes.in.tum.de/pages/1mqqqoqe7gapz/Software-Engineering-for-Business-Applications-SEBA-Master) provides the necessary theoretical foundations to design and develop state-of-the art web applications. Next to the technical aspects to develop applications for the web, business aspects are covered with the most common business models and explained with real-world examples. I served as an advisor in this course between 2022 - 2025.
