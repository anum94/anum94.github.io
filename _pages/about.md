I am a Doctoral student (Ph.D. candidate) at the Technical University of Munich, specializing in Domain Adaptation and Optimizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for Large Language Models. My current research centers on benchmarking, evaluation, and fine-tuning of LLMs to push the boundaries of domain adaptation.a

As part of my academic journey, I have actively partnered with industry leaders such as SAP and Holtzbrinck Publishing Group on various Enterprise AI projects. I am a proud member of the Industry on Campus initiative and the SAP@TUM Collaboration Lab, where I help foster and maintain collaborative research partnerships.

My background as a Computer and Information Systems engineer has given me a strong theoretical foundation in Machine Learning, with experience spanning applications in both Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. Highlights from my career include a year-long role at Munich Re working on deep learning proofs of concept for reinsurance, and my Master’s thesis—a joint project between Merck Group and TUM—focused on topic modeling of employee objectives using both classical ML and transformer models.

Outside of work, I enjoy experimenting in the kitchen, discovering new recipes, and am passionate about coffee. I am also an avid outdoor enthusiast—whether it’s hiking, cycling, running, or yoga, I embrace any opportunity to stay active and enjoy the outdoors.
