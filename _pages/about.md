I am a Doctoral student at the Technical University of Munich, specializing in Domain Adaptation in Large Language Models. My research focuses on benchmarking, evaluation, and fine-tuning of large language models to advance the field of domain adaptation. 

During my doctoral studies, I have collaborated with SAP and Holtzbrinck Publishing Group on projects related to Enterprise AI. 

I am also a proud member of the SAP@TUM Collaboration Lab, where I support SAP in establishing and maintaining research partnerships at TUM. Prior to my Ph.D., I worked at Munich Re for a year during my master's studies at TUM.

In my free-time, I like to cook and if the weather allows, indulge in outdoor sports like hiking, cycling, running. I am also passionate about Coffee.
